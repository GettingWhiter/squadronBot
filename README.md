<b>Introduction</b>

A discord bot built with discord.py for War Thunder Squadrons actively participating in squadron battles (SQBs/SREs - Squadron Realistic Events).
This branch is version 1, the bot as it was when in use within the Try Hard Coalition in early 2023.



<b>Setup</b>

Create the virtual environment, open a command prompt and type: 

python -m venv c:\squadronBot\venv


Now open the squadronBot folder with MS Visual Studio Code, terminals within this should automatically use the created venv. If not, use the following command:

c:/squadronBot/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1


Use pip within one of these terminals to install required packages:

pip install discord

pip install requests

pip install bs4

pip install lxml

pip install python-decouple

pip install jishaku
